# Simple Todo Android App

This is an Android demo application for managing Todo items: add, edit, and delete items. See the [Todo App Tutorial](http://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_android/prework) for a step-by-step tutorial for creating this app.

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Required: User add todo items one-by-one.
 * [x] Required: User can delete a todo item by long clicking on an item.
 * [x] Required: User can edit a todo item by clicking on an item.

Notes:

Spent time on not allowing user to submit blank items, both from the main screen and from the edit screen. In addition, spent time on keyboard experience: keyboard should hide on the main screen when an item is successfully added, and when a user returns to that screen after editing an item.
